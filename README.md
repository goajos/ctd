# Catch the Dot
Author: Jasper Cremers

## Introduction
Catch the dot is an interactive 2-player game. The game starts as soon as the index fingers (one on each side) are visible on the screen and the countdown is over. The goal is to catch 5 red dots. Once this is done, the application closes and announces the winner.

## Requirements
To install the correct packages, run the following command in your terminal:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to start
To start the game, run the following command in your terminal:
```
python3 red_dot_game.py
```
or
```
python red_dot_game.py
```
depending on your python installation. Enjoy the game!

## Known bugs
Sometimes the game will register the index fingers and start, but the red dots will not be grabbable. This makes scoring points and finishing the game impossible. Restart the game by pressing the "q" button and typing the above given command again.
